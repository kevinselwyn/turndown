# turndown

Utility that prevents Mac users from turning down

## Installation

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```bash
turndown
```

If the volume is turned all the way down (or muted), the volume is cranked up to 100% and DJ Snake and Lil Jon's [Turn Down For What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMUDVMiITOU) plays.
